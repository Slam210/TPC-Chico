        <h3>About TPC</h3>
        <p>The Technical Projects Club (TPC) at CSU Chico aims to foster a culture of innovation, creativity, and collaboration. Established in 2020, we've quickly grown into a community of passionate students from various technical backgrounds.</p>

        <p>We believe that the best way to learn and grow is by doing. That's why we encourage our members to collaborate on projects, attend workshops, and participate in hackathons. Our club provides the resources, mentorship, and platform for students to showcase their talents, develop new skills, and make lasting connections in the tech industry.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to create an inclusive environment where students of all skill levels can come together to work on technical projects, learn from one another, and share their knowledge with the larger CSU Chico community.</p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a future where every student at CSU Chico has the opportunity to work on real-world technical projects, and where our club alumni are leaders in tech, making a difference in their respective fields.</p>

        <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We believe that teamwork makes the dream work. Through collaboration, we achieve more than we could individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We encourage creative thinking and the pursuit of innovative solutions to real-world problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Everyone, regardless of their background or skill level, has something valuable to contribute. We aim to be a club where everyone feels welcome and heard.</li>
